# LOTUS Regression

## Installation Requirements
The code is tested on Python versions `2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6` and should work on any of them,
however we recommend using the [Anaconda python distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) which by default comes with Python
version `3.6`. 

A minimal set of requirements are the Python packages `numpy, scipy, pandas, statsmodels` which are available
by default in Anaconda.
